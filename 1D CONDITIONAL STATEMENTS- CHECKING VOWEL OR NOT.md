## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- Checking Vowel or not

## AIM  
To Write a Python program to check whether the given character is a vowel or not using if..else statement
## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Take a character input from the user
3. Convert the character to lowercase
4. Check if the lowercase character is one of the vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'
5. If it is a vowel, display "The given character is a vowel"
6. Otherwise, display "The given character is NOT a vowel"
7. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
k=input( )

if (k=='a' or k=='A' or k=='e' or k=='E' or k=='i' or k=='I' or k=='o' or k=='O' or k=='U' or k=='u' ):
    print("The given character is a vowel")
else:
    print("The given character is NOT a vowel")
```
